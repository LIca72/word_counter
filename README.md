# word_counter
# ðŸ“Š Word Counter

A **simple Python console project** that counts the frequency of each word in a sentence provided by the user.

## âœ… What this project practices:
- Using dictionaries (`dict`) to store data
- Loops (`for`) to process lists
- String methods (`split()`, `lower()`, `strip()`)
- Clean Python code structure for GitHub

## ðŸš€ How it works:
1. The user enters a sentence.
2. The program splits the sentence into words and removes punctuation.
3. It counts how many times each word appears.
4. It prints the results in a clear format.

âœ¨ A useful beginner-friendly Python project for your GitHub portfolio.
